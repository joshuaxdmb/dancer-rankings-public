# Latin Dancers App

## Your hobby's hub ü§©

This is the central hub for all those latin dancing aficionados and pros. 

## Your local DJs suck or can improve? Let them know what you like üéµ

This app allows you to vote for songs and decide what's being played at parties.
You can vote by category: salsa, bachata and zouk (more coming soon)

## Really good parties üéâ

You can also host parties and allow your invitees to vote for what song they want up next - don't worry, we're not repeating songs, unless you ask. 

## Vote for events üå∂Ô∏è

Wondering wha social is going to be good this weekend? Check out the events people are voting for and don't miss out on the best socials

## More features coming soon ü§©

### Smooth privates searching and booking

We are working with instructors to figure out a way to let you book privates - simply, and easily - from the app. You will be able to check the instructors
availability and find a time that works best for you.

### Keep track of your progress 

We will work with instructors so they can give you feedback and assign you a 'level', so you know exactly where you stand as a
leader or a follower

### Buy tickets for events ü§û

We will offer event organizers options to let you pay for tickets from the app. How will this help you? No more going to the ATM. No more carrying cash with you if you don't want to. Plus, you will be able to keep track of all the socials you go to and see how much practice you're getting (or just go down memory lane from time to time)

### Update 2025:

After several months, Spotify has rejected this app for commercial use. I‚Äôll park this project for now. YouTube seems more lenient with their APIs, so I might try switching to YouTube, or use a combination of both Spotify and YouTube to export, search, and play playlists.
